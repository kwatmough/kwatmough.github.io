		<h3>The Plan</h3>
		<i>October 12, 2016</i>
		<p>On the welcome page, I promised whisky reviews, and if you've looked around at all you may have noted that there are none. I'm guessing that you're (understandably) not very happy about that. Well don't worry, I have a plan. I promised whisky reviews, and so whisky reviews shall come. Expect me to post the first review in the next week or two. After that, I will try to post reviews fairly, hopefully at a rate of at least 1-2 each month).</p>
		<p>Also, this site looks like trash. This will be remedied.</p>
		<p>More to come soon, so stay tuned.</p>
