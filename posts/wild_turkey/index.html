		<h3>Wild Turkey Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey</h3>
		<i>October 16, 2016</i>
		<p>Here it is folks, the first review! Today I review a bourbon whiskey, Wild Turkey Kentucky Straight Bourbon. Looking at the label tells me that it was made in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, and aged a vague "up to five to eight years". The front label has the signature of their master distiller, Eddie Russell, which is kind of neat. Their <a href="http://wildturkeybourbon.com/">website</a> is surprisingly informative, check it out if you have time to waste.</p>

		<p>This bourbon offers a smell which is both mild and approachable. It is very light on the alcohol, which is nice, and, although it is difficult to discern any element in particular, the smell is pleasant, and I quite like it.</p>
		<p>The first sip is a bit empty, and not particularly exciting. There is some sweetness, but it is very mild. As I continue to sip, however, the whiskey becomes more flavourful. The sweetness I tasted in the first sip continues, and grows more pronounced as I empty the glass. It is not unpleasant, however. The whiskey is nice and creamy, which complements the sweetness. Tastes like butterscotch. Yum.</p>
		<p>I also notice some other flavours, in particular a slight sour flavour which I am not able to identify (I later checked the label and they mention vanilla, which may be what I am tasting).</p>
		<p>As to the aftertaste, the sweetness sticks around after I swallow, and builds up after each sip. The whiskey also leaves the same sort of feel in my mouth as a glass of milk, if that makes any sense. Initially, there is almost no burn. After half a dram, however, I started to notice some warmth growing at the back of my throat and in my chest. Quite nice</p>
		<p>On the whole, I found this whisky very tasty and easy to drink. Its a shame the bottle is almost empty.</p>
		<h4>9.5/12</h4>
		$31.25 at the SAQ here in Quebec, bottled at 40.5% abv.

		<h4>Cocktails and other whisk(e)y shenanigans</h4>
		<p>Note: There's no real reason to do any of this with Wild Turkey over any other whisky.</p>
		<p><b>Whiskey Sour:</b> I tried mixing myself a whiskey sour with Wild Turkey, and it turned out surprisingly good. I suspect this is more due to me getting the right balance between the whiskey, sugar and lemon juice than this whiskey being suited for sours.</p>

		<p><b>Maple Syrup Shots:</b> I suppose maple syrup shots should really be done with canadian whisky, but Wild Turkey worked fine in one. But then again, there's very little that doesn't taste great when you mix it with maple syrup.</p>
		<p><b>Whiskey with Must:</b> My friends and I spent much of yesterday brewing our first batch of mead. One of the meads was a cyser (apple mead), and after transferring to a carboy we had some leftover must (that's the water/honey mixture which is to be fermented, in this case it was basically apple juice with a lot of honey and spices). So of course we decided to mix it with whiskey. Tasted really good, which makes me think that we should all be drinking more spiked apple cider.</p>
