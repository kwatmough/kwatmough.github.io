		<p><b>Coming soon.</b></p>
		<p>The chronicle of a young pleb who is struck with the sudden desire to review whisky. Join him as he travels far and wide in his pointless quest to taste every mediocre whisky he can get his hands on.</p>
		
		<blockquote><i>"This kinda sucks right now, but it has the potential for greatness." </i> -A wise pleb.</blockquote>
		<blockquote><i>"What the hell is this?" </i> -An inferior pleb.</blockquote>
		
		
		<p>As soon as I finish setting up the site, I will start posting reviews of whisky as often as I have the time (and money).</p>
